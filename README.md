# Module #1 Challenge: Code Refactor, Horiseon

## Description

This project is a feature request challenge. This challenge involved refactoring an existing site to **make it more accessible**. This project was refactored to include:

* semantic HTML elements in source code
* logical structure of HTML elements
* accessible alt attributes for image elements
* sequential order of heading attributes
* a concise, descriptive title in the title element

In addition, I have also:

* fixed links to function correctly
* organized CSS sheet to follow semantic structure
* commented CSS file for better readability
* deployed live [URL](https://desguerra.github.io/horiseon/)
* modified project to resemble the design mockup

Here is the link to [the completed challenge!](https://desguerra.github.io/horiseon/)
